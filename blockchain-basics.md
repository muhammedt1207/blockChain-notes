# 🔐 Hashing & Blockchain Basics



---

## 🧩 What is Hashing?

Hashing is like turning any input (text, file, number) into a fixed-length string of characters. It's done using special functions called **hash functions**.

### 🔑 Quick Points:
- A hash is like a **digital fingerprint**.
- Even a small change in input gives a **totally different hash** (this is called the avalanche effect).
- Hashing is **one-way** — you can't reverse it to get original data.
- Common hash functions: `SHA-256`, `MD5`, `SHA-1` (but MD5 and SHA-1 are insecure today).

### 🔁 Example:
```
Input: "hello"
SHA-256: 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
```

Hashing is used a lot in password protection, digital signatures, and of course... BLOCKCHAIN!

## ⛓️ What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is like a chain of blocks... literally! Each block holds data and its own hash — along with the previous block's hash.

### ✍️ Imagine:
```
Block 1 ➝ Block 2 ➝ Block 3 ➝ ...
```

If someone tries to change a block's data, its hash changes — breaking the chain!

### 💡 Key Ideas:
- It's decentralized — no single company owns it.
- It's immutable — once data is added, it's super hard to tamper.
- It's transparent — everyone can view the data.
- It's run by nodes (computers) across the world.

## 🧠 What Does Blockchain Know?

You can think of a blockchain like a public diary where:
- Each entry (block) is time-stamped.
- It knows the history of all changes (like a version control system).
- It can be verified by anyone.
- The blockchain doesn't know "who you are," but it knows what your wallet address has done.

## 🌍 Famous Blockchains You Should Know

| Blockchain | Purpose / Use Case | Language |
|------------|-------------------|----------|
| Bitcoin | Digital currency (first-ever blockchain) | C++ |
| Ethereum | Smart contracts & dApps | Solidity |
| Solana | High-speed, low-fee dApps & tokens | Rust, C |
| Polygon | Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum | Solidity |
| BNB Chain | Fast transactions, mostly DeFi & gaming | Solidity |
| Avalanche | DeFi, NFTs, multi-chain support | Solidity, Rust |
| Near | User-friendly dApps, human-readable addresses | Rust, AssemblyScript |

Different blockchains = different communities, speeds, costs, and dev tools.

## 🤔 Why Should I Care?

Understanding hashing and blockchains is the core of everything — tokens, NFTs, smart contracts, DeFi — all of it builds on this.

So yeah... pretty important stuff. 💪
